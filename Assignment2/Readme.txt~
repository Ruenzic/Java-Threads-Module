Name: Concurrency in typing game.

Description: This is a java program to run a typing game where the user has to type out and enter the words that are falling down the screen before they reach the bottom. Using concurrency and thread safety to do this. 

The program uses the Java Model-View-Controller method. The model is WordRecord.java, view is WordPanel.java and the controller is WordApp.java.

Instructions to run program with given lists:
1. In the Ubuntu Terminal, go to the directory where WordApp.java is stored. (cd DirectoryAddress).
2. In the Terminal, type "make" to compile all nessassary files. 
3. Then to run the program, type "java WordApp" followed by the paramters for the program on the same like.
the first parameter is the total number of words you want to fall before the game ends, the second parameter is the total number of words you want to have on the screen at any given time. and the 3rd parameter is the name of the txt file containing the words. For example "java WordApp 30 3 example_dict.txt" will run the game. 

If you want to configure the program to go through a different list of words, simply put it in the parameter, make sure the txt file is in the same file as the rest of the program though.

List of files: Score.java, WordRecord.java, WordApp.java, WordPanel.java, WordDictionary.java, Readme.txt, Makefile.
